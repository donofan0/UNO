# UNO
*This is a java game with a GUI for playing UNO
*There is a full writeup of this project in the description.pdf
*This project was made as a final project in my CS211 module.  That is why all the code is in one file, as it was a requirement of the project so that the professor could copy-paste it into the IDE.
*I would have preferred to comment on the code more and have it in multiple files rather than having a pdf file to explain it, but that was also a requirement of the project.
